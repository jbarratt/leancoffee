        <h3>What is a Lean Coffee?</h3>
        <p>A Lean Coffee is a simple framework for adding some structure a conversation, making it much more productive.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>An overall topic or theme is selected.</li>
          <li>Participants share topics they would be interested in discussing.</li>
          <li>All participants then vote on the topics, selecting a few they want to discuss.</li>
          <li>Starting from the most popular and working down, each topic is discussed for a few minutes, and then conversation moves to the next topic.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          And that's all there is to it!
          You can find more from the founders at <a href="http://leancoffee.org">leancoffee.org</a>.

        <h3>How does leancoffee.online work?</h3>
          <p>Click above to start your own coffee. You'll pick a short code that's easy to remember and some other settings.</p>
          <p>Now simply share the link with the other people joining the discussion, or have them come to the site and enter the code.
            No logins, no passwords, no accounts.</p>
          <p>As the creator, you'll have extra controls to move the session along. All participants will be able to enter topics, vote,
            and see what topics are under discussion and coming up next.</p>

        <h3>Why Lean Coffee Online?</h3>
        <p>Typically a Lean Coffee is done face to face, with stickies or index cards, and a physical Kanban board type layout.
          With the advent of videoconferencing, though, great discussions can still be had even when groups of people are distributed,
          and other collaborative work tools like docs or spreadsheets make it hard to gather topics, and for the facilitator to really participate.
        </p>
        <p>The site was built for 2 main goals: so I could use it for my own remote Coffee sessions, and to experiment with Full Stack™ Serverless™ Responsive™ Single-Page-App™ Technologies.

          To that end it's <a href="https://github.com/jbarratt/leancoffee">fully open source</a>; pull requests are, of course welcome.
